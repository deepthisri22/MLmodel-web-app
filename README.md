# MLmodel-web-app

This is a simple project to demonstrate how Machine Learning Models can be deployed on production using Flask API.

This demo uses a simple [Iris dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) and performs classification using Random Forest.
The trained model can be deployed on the server like AWS or Heroku.
